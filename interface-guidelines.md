## Interface Guidelines

Games can use the OUYA controller buttons however they wish, but we recommend the following mappings for the O, U, Y, and A buttons. If you're running a stock Android application that's not OUYA-aware, this is also how the buttons will be mapped to the standard Android navigation buttons on a typical device's navigation bar.
```text
OUYA    Color    Default Function
O       green    select
U       blue     options (Android's menu function)
Y       yellow   -
A       red      back/cancel
```

Please use the names below when referring to the controller buttons in your game's help screens:
```text
O, U, Y, A
System (the home button)
D-Pad 
LS (the left joystick movement)
L1 (the left bumper)
L2 (the left trigger)
L3 (the button function of pressing the left joystick straight down)
RS
R1
R2
R3
Touchpad (not "Trackpad")
```
You may also incorporate the following button icons into your game's help screens if you wish.
