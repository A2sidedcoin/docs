## ODK Roadmap

* **Launcher** - This is still in development. For example, we are still implementing the display of game information like description, screenshots, etc.

* **Controller** - Will be adding controller connected/disconnected events for games to hook into.

* **Touchpad** - Making this more useful (hiding the cursor, setting mouse position, etc).

* **Gamer details** - We will be exposing the gamer's username to games.

* **Unity** - Improving controller input performance, simplifying IAP calls.
