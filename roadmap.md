## ODK Roadmap

* **Launcher** - This is still in its earliest stages of development. For example, we are still implementing the display of game information like description, screenshots, etc. This will launch when we launch the gamer-facing discovery service.

* **Controller** - Will be adding controller connected/disconnected events for games to hook into.

* **Touchpad** - Making this more useful (hiding the cursor, setting mouse position, etc).

* **Gamer details** - We will be exposing the gamer's username to games.

* **Unity** - Improving controller input performance, simplifying IAP calls.

Please post your feedback on the [developer forums](http://forums.ouya.tv). We know there is a lot to add, and we want your help in shaping it.
