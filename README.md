# ODK Documentation

*This is a pre-alpha preview. Please contribute at https://github.com/ouya/docs*

Welcome to the OUYA Development Kit (ODK) - the software used to create games and applications for the OUYA console. 

**Important Note:** This preview version of the ODK is a work in progress, and is still under heavy development: 
- The payments API security features are not yet implemented.
- APIs for video resolution switching and controller enumeration are not yet implemented. 
- The included sample application requires a touchscreen.
- The OUYA launcher (the console's dashboard application) is only minimally usable. The game browser and store functions do not yet work. Game icons and related metadata are not displayed. Some actions still require a touchscreen. The Developers section of the launcher is partly functional, and can be used to view and downloaded applications that were previously uploaded at the OUYA Developer Portal web site.
