# OUYA Development Kit Documentation (Pre-Alpha Preview)

Welcome to the OUYA ODK - the software development kit used to create games and applications for the OUYA console. 

**Important Note:** This preview version of the ODK is a work in progress, and is still under heavy development: 
- The payments API security features are not yet implemented.
- APIs for video resolution switching and controller enumeration are not yet implemented. 
- The included sample application requires a touchscreen.
- The OUYA launcher (the console's dashboard application) is only minimally usable. The game browser and store functions do not yet work. Game icons and related metadata are not displayed. Some actions still require a touchscreen. The Developers section of the launcher is partly functional, and can be used to view and downloaded applications that were previously uploaded at the OUYA Developer Portal web site.

For help and support, visit the developer forums at http://forums.ouya.tv, or email devsupport@ouya.tv.

### ODK Contents
- **Documentation:** This directory contains documentation that gives you an overview of the OUYA ODK and OUYA's in-app purchasing facility, and helps you set up the build environment.
- **Licenses:** The OUYA ODK depends on several open-source libraries. This directory contains a license file for each of these libraries.
- **Samples:** Sample applications to show you how to use the OUYA ODK.
- **javadoc:** Class- and method-level documentation for the OUYA ODK. This is viewable from any web browser.
- **libs:** The OUYA ODK and libraries that it depends on.
